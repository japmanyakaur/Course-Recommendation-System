# Course-Recommendation-System



##  Overview 

This project is an AI-powered ** Study Course recommendation engine** that helps users quickly find the most relevant courses based on their learning goals. The system uses **NLP**, **Sentence Transformers**, and **cosine similarity** to match user queries to course content. The interface is powered by **Streamlit**, making it interactive and easy to use. 

## Project Objective 

- Recommend the most relevant  courses based on natural language input.
- Leverage semantic similarity using **MiniLM embeddings**.
- Build a  user-friendly app interface.
- Provide scalable, batch-encoded recommendations in real-time.



##  Features 

- Upload your own  CSV dataset (supports large datasets). 
-  Free-text query input (e.g., "learn DSA in C++"). 
-  Fast, accurate recommendations using vector similarity. 
-   frontend built with **Streamlit**.
